# Parwest ERP Documentation

Welcome to the Parwest ERP documentation. This guide provides a clear starting point for understanding the ERP's purpose, modules, and how to get set up.

## Purpose
Parwest ERP centralizes core business operations (finance, inventory, sales, HR, and reporting) in a single system to improve visibility and efficiency.

## Audience
- Business stakeholders who need a high-level view of system capabilities.
- Implementers who configure modules and workflows.
- Developers who extend or integrate the ERP.

## Core Modules (Overview)
- **Finance & Accounting**: General ledger, accounts payable/receivable, budgeting, and financial reporting.
- **Inventory & Warehouse**: Stock tracking, movements, replenishment, and warehouse operations.
- **Sales & CRM**: Leads, opportunities, quotes, orders, and customer management.
- **Purchasing**: Vendor management, purchase orders, approvals, and receiving.
- **HR & Payroll**: Employee records, time tracking, payroll processing, and benefits.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Dashboards, KPIs, and exportable reports.

## Getting Started
1. **Define requirements**: List the modules and workflows your organization needs.
2. **Set up roles**: Create user roles and permission groups for each department.
3. **Configure modules**: Enable modules and map fields to your business processes.
4. **Import data**: Load master data (customers, vendors, items, accounts) before transactions.

## Documentation Structure (Suggested)
Create the following sections as the ERP evolves:
- **Architecture**: High-level system architecture, deployment, and integrations.
- **Module Guides**: Detailed workflows and configuration per module.
- **Data Model**: Key entities, relationships, and data dictionaries.
- **API Reference**: Endpoints, authentication, and example requests.
- **Operations**: Backups, monitoring, logging, and maintenance.

## Contributing
To expand this documentation:
1. Create a new file in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/modules/finance.md`).
2. Use clear headings, numbered procedures, and examples.
3. Keep content modular and link related topics.

## Next Steps
- Identify the priority modules to document first.
- Add system-specific configuration steps.
- Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful.
